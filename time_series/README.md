In the "time_series" subdirectory: you will find a file showing hourly temperature readings for a variety of cities around the world over several years, 
from 2012 through 2017 (extracted from [this Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/selfishgene/historical-hourly-weather-data)). Plot the temperature reading 
for Detroit for this time using a standard matplotlib line plot. In addition, try to calculate the average temperature for each month, 
as well as the minimum and maximum temperature for that month, and plot it on top of the raw data. 
What does this reveal, if anything, that the raw data does not?
