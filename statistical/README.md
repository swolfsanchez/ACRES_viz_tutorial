In the "statistical" subdirectory: you will find a data file, congress-terms.csv, which includes an entry for every member 
of the US Congress who served between January 1947 and Februrary 2014 (and which was downloaded from the FiveThirtyEight.com GitHub repository). 
This information contains the number of the Congress where they served, their name, birthday, starting date, and the age they were when they began 
that particular Congress. For this project, letâ€™s focus on the starting ages of congresspeople and senators - how old are they when they start their terms? 

Come up with two substantially different ways to visualize this data, write a piece of Python code to make those visualizations, 
and include the code and visualization in the repository. You may want to use either Pandas or NumPy's genfromtxt method to ingest the data, 
and then some sort of matplotlib plot to visualize it.
